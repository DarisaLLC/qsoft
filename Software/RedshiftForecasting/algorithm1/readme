SUMMARY OF APPROACH TO CLASSIFICATION

SUMMARY OF FILES

lotsTrees.R - There is a lot of cross validation and tuning that goes on with algorithm1. At the end of the day we get out a single tree, built on all of the data. The purpose of lotsTrees.R is to give a sense of what the classifier we use will actually be. lotsTrees.R builds trees with every prior we are considering for each set of features we have (recall there are 4 sets of features, the features we have increase with time as SWIFT gets more information).

priorsloss.R - This file is for practice with the rpart function in R, trying to determine how the parameters 'loss' and 'prior' work together. After some experimenting it appears that both (loss and prior) adjust the splitting criteria optimization. This could be used to account for the fact that either 1) misclassification costs are different in different classes or 2) in the test set to be classified the priors will not match the empirical priors in the training set. The comments do a pretty good job of explaining what is happening. Reading section 4.4 in CART by Breiman et al. should give a decent understanding of what is going on here.

algorithm1.R - has functions to choose the prior probability of high based on the fraction of bursts we can follow up on (alpha). see comments in this file for details
