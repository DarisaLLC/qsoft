for: GRB prediction group

date: June 8, 2010

This folder contains files building CART classification trees to predict GRBs as high or low redshift, as well as subsequent analysis of the results. As discussed in our meeting on Tuesday June 8, there are several areas where this work needs to be improved including repeated runs of cross validation and better analysis of importance of each feature in prediction.

The files are:

====Data====
redshiftmachine.arff

====R CODE====
basicClassifier - R code for analyzing data in redshiftmachine.arff
functions - R code, a bunch of R functions used by basicClassifier for analyzing data

==== tex ====
report.tex - tex source code for write up
report.pdf - compiled tex for viewing

==== various other pdfs =====
These are figures generated by basicClassifier that are used in report.tex. Each time code is run, these will be regenerated and recompiling report.tex will change output.
