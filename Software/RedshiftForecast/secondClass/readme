The files are:

====Data====
redshiftmachine.arff

====R CODE====
betterClassifier - R code for analyzing data in redshiftmachine.arff
functions - R code, a bunch of R functions used by basicClassifier for analyzing data

==== tex ====
report.tex - tex source code for write up
report.pdf - compiled tex for viewing

==== various other pdfs =====
These are figures generated by betterClassifier that are used in report.tex. Each time code is run, these will be regenerated and recompiling report.tex will change output.

To run the R code, open R and type:

source('betterClassifier')

This will run the analysis and create all the necessary output to compile report.tex
